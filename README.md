# Grabs a random image from Imgur, open source C#.

#### Generates a random string and attempts to download an image using it from Imgur.
* Truly useless, although, it is fun seeing the random and fucked up things people share.
  * Lots of porn and creepy screenshots of women btw. Just putting that out there.
  * Random game screenshots, mostly from the GTA Franchise or Runescape. 
##### Shitty code, enjoy reading it. 


###### This code was written before I cared about having a tidy codebase and having actual good code. I don't care enough to rewrite this though as I literally made this for shits and giggles
